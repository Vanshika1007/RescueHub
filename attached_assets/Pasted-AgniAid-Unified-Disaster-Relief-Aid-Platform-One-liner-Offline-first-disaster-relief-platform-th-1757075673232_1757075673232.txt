AgniAid — Unified Disaster Relief & Aid Platform One-liner Offline-first disaster relief platform that empowers survivors, volunteers, NGOs, and donors with real-time coordination, AI-powered matching, transparent donations via blockchain, and low-connectivity support — ensuring no cry for help goes unheard. 🌎 Problem Statement Disaster zones often face connectivity outages, resource mismatch, and chaotic coordination between victims, volunteers, NGOs, and donors. Survivors can’t always get their requests logged, and NGOs struggle with transparency and allocation of funds/resources. Donations are often questioned. AgniAid solves this by offering a unified, offline-capable relief app with real-time updates, AI-driven matching, blockchain donation tracking, and multiple fallback channels (app, SMS, calls, voice assistants). 🧾 Features & Modules 1) User roles & access Roles: affected_user, volunteer, NGO, donor, admin. Secure signup/login (phone OTP, email OAuth). Role-based permissions. 2FA for NGOs & Admins. 2) Request Help (survivors) Minimal “Help Me” form: Auto-capture GPS (lat/lng, accuracy). Request type: food, shelter, medical, evac, water, rescue. People count, priority, optional photo/video. Accessibility flags (elderly, kids, injured). Request lifecycle → pending → assigned → enroute → resolved → closed. Reassignment if volunteer times out. Offline first: Requests stored in IndexedDB + Background Sync. SMS fallback: LOCATION:lat,lng;TYPE:MEDICAL;PHONE:xxxx. Push/SMS confirmation when request is received. 3) Real-time volunteer/NGO coordination Socket.IO WebSocket channel /ws/requests: Get live requests nearby. Push notifications for volunteers. Volunteer app view: Accept/decline jobs. Live status (on my way, arrived, completed). GPS tracking & ETA sharing with requestor. 4) AI-powered matching 🚀 (innovation highlight) Matching engine: Ranks NGOs/volunteers/resources for each request. Inputs include: distance, ETA, volunteer availability, NGO resources, ratings, live weather/road conditions. Ranking model: XGBoost or TensorFlow model. Disaster prediction service: Integrates weather/seismic/flood APIs → generates heatmaps & early alerts with push notifications. Active learning loop: System improves based on feedback/rating. 5) Donations + Blockchain transparency 💰 Fiat: Stripe/Razorpay/PayPal. Crypto: Ethereum / Layer-2 (Polygon, Arbitrum). Smart contract logs donation metadata (donor ID, amount, timestamp, allocated area). On-chain hash + off-chain DB for details. NGO request withdrawal → multisig approval + KYC verification. Donor portal UI: transaction receipts, allocation transparency. 6) NGO & Volunteer management NGO onboarding: KYC → admin approval → resource inventory (warehouses, vehicles). Volunteer profiles: skills, verification docs, vehicle type, rating system. Leaderboards, badges, “Verified Hero” status. 7) Drone delivery (POC / nice-to-have) Simulated drone hub API → request a drop to coordinates. Safety checks & approval workflow. 8) Emergency feed + Voice Assistant Feed of live alerts: govt advisories, weather warnings, local verified updates. Voice-assisted help request → speech-to-text (Google/Azure). Multilingual support: Hindi/English + local languages (powered by i18n + TTS). 9) Security & Compliance HTTPS + JWT with refresh tokens. Encrypted PII. Obfuscated phone numbers (only assigned responders see full). GDPR-like privacy compliance (export/delete). Rate limiting & abuse detection. 10) Monitoring & Ops Prometheus + Grafana dashboards: response time, time-to-assign, time-to-resolve, active users, donation logs. Error monitoring: Sentry. Auto-scaling for surge handling. 🎨 UI & Frontend (wow factor) Tech: React (PWA) + TailwindCSS + Framer Motion for animations. Features: Map view with real-time requests displayed on Leaflet/Google Maps. Offline badge when disconnected. Beautiful dark mode for disaster responders at night. Subtle hero page animation: 🔥 flame ripple effect on logo (AgniAid). Multilingual toggle. 📡 API Endpoints (core) POST /api/auth/signup POST /api/auth/login POST /api/auth/otp POST /api/requests (create request) GET /api/requests/:id (request details) GET /api/requests/nearby?lat=&lng=&radius= (volunteer feed) POST /api/requests/:id/assign PATCH /api/requests/:id/status POST /api/ai/match (request_id → ranked responders) GET /api/ai/riskmap?bbox= POST /api/donations GET /api/donations/:id/verify GET /api/admin/ngo-approvals POST /api/admin/verify-ngo/:id WebSocket: /ws/requests 🛠️ Tech Stack Frontend: React (PWA), TailwindCSS, Framer Motion, Leaflet. Backend: Node.js (NestJS/Express), Socket.IO, Redis. Databases: MongoDB (requests), PostgreSQL (donations). AI Service: Flask/FastAPI + TensorFlow/XGBoost. Blockchain: Solidity + Ethers.js / Web3.js. Storage: AWS S3 / MinIO. Telephony: Twilio SMS + calls. Deployment: Docker + K8s (EKS/GKE). Monitoring: Prometheus + Grafana + Sentry. ✅ Hackathon Wow-Additions (Judges’ Favorites) Offline-first with SMS fallback → Works even without internet. AI-powered risk forecast + matching → predictive + smart allocation. Transparent Crypto + Fiat donations → solves trust problem in disaster aid. Voice Assistance + Multilingual UI → accessibility inclusivity. Drone simulation delivery → futuristic touch. Gamified volunteer leaderboard → increasing motivation. Early warning heatmap visualization → visually cool demo. 📦 Deliverables Working React PWA (mobile-first) with offline-first request feature. Functional API with authentication, request lifecycle, WebSocket updates. AI service stub for matching + risk heatmap mock. Donation integration with blockchain logging (testnet). NGO onboarding & volunteer management UI. README + Dockerized setup (easy local deploy)
